A (partial) Org Mode parser in Clojure.

![build](https://github.com/eigenhombre/clj-org/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/clj-org/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/clj-org)

This library parses Emacs [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org/) format to
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), which is a tree
representation of HTML in the form of nested Clojure vectors.

## Getting Started

Add the above dependency to `project.clj`:

Add to your `project.clj` or `deps.edn`:

    [eigenhombre/clj-org "0.0.2"]

Then, use `clj-org.org/parse-org` to convert a string of Org Mode text into
Hiccup.

## Example

    (ns myproject.core
      (:require [clj-org.org :refer [parse-org]]))
    
    (parse-org "#+TITLE: This is an Org Mode file.

    * This is the outer section
    ** This is an inner section
    Inner section body -- /with italic text/!  And *bold text* too.

    - Plain List Item 1
    - Plain List Item 2
    [[http://eigenhombre.com][A link to a Web site]]
    ")

... yields:

    {:title "This is an Org Mode file.",
     :headers "\n#+TITLE: This is an Org Mode file.\n\n",
     :content
     [:div
      [:h1 [:p "This is the outer section"]]
      [:h2 [:p "This is an inner section"]]
      [:span
       [:p
	[:span
	 [:span
	  "Inner section body &#x2013; "
	  [:em "with italic text"]
	  "!  And "]
	 [:strong "bold text"]
	 " too.\n"]]
       [:ul
	[:li [:p "Plain List Item 1\n"]]
	[:li [:p "Plain List Item 2\n"]]]
       [:p
	[:span
	 [:a {:href "http://eigenhombre.com"} "A link to a Web site"]
	 "\n"]]]]}

## Implementation

Factored out of the [blorg](https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg) blog
prototype, this parser started out as an
[Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) grammar.
However, it proved too difficult to get good performance without
ambiguities, so the parser has become what is basically a series of
monster regular expressions ([example
here](https://github.com/eigenhombre/clj-org/blob/master/src/clj_org/org.clj#L361)).
